                Our pickles have a shelf life of 12-18 months when stored properly. The exact shelf life for each product is mentioned on the label and product page. Always keep the jar tightly sealed after use and store in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight.

                Do your pickles contain preservatives?

              <AccordionContent className="px-6 pb-4 text-gray-700">
                No, we don't add any artificial preservatives to our pickles. The natural preservation comes from salt, oil, and the traditional pickling process. The high oil and salt content, along with our careful preparation methods, naturally preserve the pickles.
